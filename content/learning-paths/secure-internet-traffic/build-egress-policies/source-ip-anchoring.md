Source IP anchoring has become increasingly common recently as businesses begin to shift more traffic out of their office perimeter but still rely on their corporate IPs as a primary source of truth for trusted egress. Cloudflare understands the relevance of this model.

The next section discusses best practices for migrating from managing backhauled user traffic in the context of IP allowlisting to delivering consistent security practices and IP consistency without sacrificing performance.
