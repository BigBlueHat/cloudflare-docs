{{<glossary-definition term_id="Cloudflare CASB">}}

Cloudflare's API-implemented CASB addresses the final, common security concern for administrators of SaaS applications or security organizations: How can I get insights into the existing configurations of my SaaS tools and proactively address issues before there is an incident? CASB integrates with a number of leading SaaS applications and surfaces instant security insights related to misconfiguration and potential for data loss. CASB also powers [risk score heuristics](/cloudflare-one/insights/risk-score/) organized by severity.

For more information on Cloudflare CASB, including available SaaS integrations, refer to [Scan SaaS applications](/cloudflare-one/applications/scan-apps/).
